The user can sign out from the app by selecting Sign out from the menu in the upper right corner.

## Bill Notifications
When a tax agent or the system issues a bill with a deferred payment, the taxpayer is promptly notified through the **Billy** app. A notification is sent from **SMARTr Cloud** directly to the taxpayer's phone, appearing in the notification bar for easy access.

For example, an agent may schedule a payment due in 5 days. If the taxpayer has activated Billy, they will receive a timely notification about the upcoming payment. The taxpayer can then use **Billy** to initiate the payment at their convenience, ensuring they stay on top of their obligations without hassle.
