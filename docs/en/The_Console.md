# Admin Console Overview

![Console Login](images/login_page.webp)
The **Admin Console** is designed to track payments, mobile money (MoMo) transactions, and customer (taxpayer) registrations.

To access it, open your browser and visit {== [https://console.smartr.cloud](https://console.smartr.cloud)==}. Log in using the credentials registered received when registering with **TAPx**.

## User Roles

The console supports two types of users:

- **Customer Admin**
- **Country Admin**

### Customer Admin

A **Customer Admin** can access all payments and registrations associated with their company.  
For instance, a municipality admin can view all relevant transactions within their domain.

Customers using **POSx** can access all payment data generated by the app. However, **registrations do not apply** to them.

### Country Admin

A **Country Admin** has full access to all payments, MoMo transactions, and registrations across the entire country.

**Access rights** for both roles are assigned by the **Country Manager**.

## Payments Chart

The **Payments Chart** is the first page users see upon logging in.  
Use the **Date Range Picker** in the upper-right corner to select a date range for analysis. By default, it displays data from the past month.
